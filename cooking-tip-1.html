                    <h3>Tip: Use the right tools</h3>
                    <p>Having the right tools in your kitchen can make a big difference in your cooking experience and results. Some of the essential tools that every home cook should have are:</p>
                    <ul style="padding-inline-start: 40px; list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>A sharp chef's knife and a cutting board</li>
                        <li>A wooden spoon and a spatula</li>
                        <li>A large skillet and a saucepan</li>
                        <li>A set of measuring cups and spoons</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Tip: Preheat your oven</h3>   
                    <p>One of the most common mistakes that home cooks make is not preheating their oven before baking or roasting. This can result in uneven cooking, undercooked or overcooked food, and wasted time and energy. Preheating your oven ensures that your food will start cooking at the right temperature as soon as you put it in, and that it will cook faster and more evenly. To preheat your oven, simply turn it on to the desired temperature and wait for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the oven indicator light turns off or beeps. You can also use an oven thermometer to check the accuracy of your oven's temperature. To summarize:</p>
                    <ul style="padding-inline-start: 40px; list-style-type: circle;">
                        <li>Common mistake: not preheating oven = uneven cooking, wasted time/energy</li>
                        <li>Preheating = even cooking, right temp, faster cooking</li>
                        <li>To preheat: turn on oven, wait 15-20 mins or until light/beep</li>
                        <li>Use oven thermometer to check temp accuracy</li>
                    </ul>
