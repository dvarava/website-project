                    <h3>Tip: Preheat your oven</h3>   
                    <p>One of the most common mistakes that home cooks make is not preheating their oven before baking or roasting. This can result in uneven cooking, undercooked or overcooked food, and wasted time and energy. Preheating your oven ensures that your food will start cooking at the right temperature as soon as you put it in, and that it will cook faster and more evenly. To preheat your oven, simply turn it on to the desired temperature and wait for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the oven indicator light turns off or beeps. You can also use an oven thermometer to check the accuracy of your oven's temperature.</p>
