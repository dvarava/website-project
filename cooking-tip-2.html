            <h2>How To Cook A Perfect Steak Every Time</h2>
            <p>This is the best way to cook a steak, without a doubt. And if that didn't get you... It takes little to no active time, is all done in a pan, and is extremely easy as long as you follow some of these really simple rules. Plus, with  Valentines day coming around the corner, and also because steak is the best, this seemed like a good idea to upload. So whether you're cooking a ribeye, t-bone, sirloin, or strip steak, this recipe is for you. </p>
